# Vim9cord

Vim9cord is a pure vim9script plugin for Discord RPC. Currently a proof-of-concept (it works!), full implementation coming Soon:tm:.

## Requirements

Currently, only Linux and non-Flatpak/non-Snap discord is supported. **This plugin will not work on Windows or Mac** - but on unsupported platforms or with unsupported Discord installations, it should quietly error out. If you'd like this to change, consider submitting a pull request.

Aside this, Vim 9.1 or newer is required. Vim 9.0 or newer may also work, but support for 9.0 and earlier is not intentional.
